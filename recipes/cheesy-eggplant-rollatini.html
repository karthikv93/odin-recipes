        <li>1 ½ cups marinara sauce </li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle kosher salt over eggplant slices. Let excess moisture drain from eggplant, 10 to 15 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels and transfer to baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with black pepper.</li>
        <li>Combine spinach, onion, and garlic in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until spinach is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Mix Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and ricotta cheese together in a bowl. Stir in spinach mixture until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Spread 2 spoonfuls of spinach mixture evenly over each eggplant slice. Roll up eggplant.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/4 cup marinara sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
            Arrange eggplant rolls seam-side down in the dish. 
            Pour remaining marinara sauce over rolls. Cover with mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden, about 1 hour. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
